# Postprocessing-cluster-with-LAMMPS-atom-trajectory

This repository contains Python scripts used in our publication in IJHMT (Shi et al., Int. J. Heat Mass Transf. 228, 125623 (2024); doi: 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125623).

These two Python scripts can read the Dump data as one of the standard output formats of LAMMPS, and the ID and position of atoms are used to calculate the nucleation rate and critical nucleus size for all-atom water molecule models.

If you have any problem using the scripts, please don't hesitate to email me.
